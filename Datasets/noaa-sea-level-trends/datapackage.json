Serving both the public and other government agencies, CO-OPS is the authoritative source for accurate, reliable, and timely water-level and current measurements that support safe and efficient maritime commerce, sound coastal management, and recreation. The combined efforts, knowledge, and experience of CO-OPS's technicians, scientists, and engineers working to carry out a central mission has led to the development of a reliable center of expertise for coastal physical oceanography.\n\n_Source: [noaa.gov](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/sltrends/mslUSTrendsTable.htm)_","homepage":"https://data.world/noaa/sea-level-trends","resources":[{"name":"usstationslinearsealeveltrends","schema":{"fields":[{"name":"station_id","title":"Station ID","type":"integer","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer","dwSourceId":"station_id"},{"name":"station_name","title":"Station Name","type":"string","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string","dwSourceId":"station_name"},{"name":"first_year","title":"First Year","type":"gyear","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYear","dwSourceId":"first_year"},{"name":"last_year","title":"Last Year","type":"gyear","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYear","dwSourceId":"last_year"},{"name":"year_range","title":"Year Range","type":"integer","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer","dwSourceId":"year_range"},{"name":"complete","title":"% Complete","type":"integer","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer","dwSourceId":"complete"},{"name":"msl_trends_mm_yr","title":"MSL Trends (mm/yr)","type":"number","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#decimal","dwSourceId":"msl_trends_mm_yr"},{"name":"95_ci_mm_yr","title":"+/- 95% CI (mm/yr)","type":"number","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#decimal","dwSourceId":"95_ci_mm_yr"},{"name":"msl_trend_ft_century","title":"MSL Trend (ft/century)","type":"number","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#decimal","dwSourceId":"msl_trend_ft_century"},{"name":"95_ci_ft_century","title":"+/- 95% CI (ft/century)","type":"number","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#decimal","dwSourceId":"95_ci_ft_century"},{"name":"latitude","title":"Latitude","type":"number","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#decimal","dwSourceId":"latitude"},{"name":"longitude","title":"Longitude","type":"number","rdfType":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#decimal","dwSourceId":"longitude"},{"name":"location","title":" Location","type":"string","rdfType":"http://www.opengis.net/ont/OGC-GeoSPARQL/1.0/Point","dwSourceId":"location"}]},"path":"data/usstationslinearsealeveltrends.csv","format":"csv"},{"name":"original/Sea Level Trends.png","path":"original/Sea Level Trends.png","format":"png","mediatype":"image/png","bytes":636781},{"name":"original/USStationsLinearSeaLevelTrends.csv","path":"original/USStationsLinearSeaLevelTrends.csv","format":"csv","mediatype":"text/csv","bytes":11622},{"name":"original/sea_level_chart_by_quanticdata.png","description":"source: public.tableau.com/profile/stephen.myers#!/vizhome/NOAAMeanSeaLevel/PopulationandSeaLevelMap   \nby: @quanticdata","path":"original/sea_level_chart_by_quanticdata.png","format":"png","mediatype":"image/png","bytes":776531}],"keywords":["in the news","climate","sea levels","warming","environment","oceans","global climate change data","oceanography"]}
